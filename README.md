## Project Status
The project has a "completed for now" status. 


## Project Description
This is a simple simulation of a Casio MJ-12VCb-BU 300 desktop calculator with most functions available as they would be on the device itself. 
Currently, there are no functions planned for the 'AUTO REVIEW' button, the mark-up 'MU' button or the up/down chevron buttons. If these functions were simulated, they would keep track of 300 separate calculations while the 'AUTO REVIEW' button would display each calculation individually. That said, 

As a calculator template, I used a version credited to Yuvraj Chandra (see reference section) and created functions as needed to make the calculator as realistic as possible. The project used one(1) HTML file, one(1) CSS file and one(1) vanilla javascript file. I included a personal calculator font, however, allowed other fonts as back up should the files be downloaded. The 'AC_ON' button is an image and UTF-8 character encoding for many of the operator keys.

This project's CSS component was the primary challenge. The browser's local storage was used for the calculator's "memory". For simplicity, I used only the apostrophes as separators. The calculator acutally uses 3 different separators. 


## Installation
No special instructions


## Contributing
